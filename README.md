 ## Interactive Shiny Applications for Teaching Statistics
In fall 2013, I created various shiny applications that would help students visualize basic statistical concepts for my capstone project at Winona State University.  These applications were built when shiny was in beta (0.4.0) and no longer work under the current release. 

I have updated the code behind my binomial simulation app so it will work in the latest release of RStudio's shiny. 

You can interact with my app [here](https://brehartfiel.shinyapps.io/shiny-for-teaching/).
